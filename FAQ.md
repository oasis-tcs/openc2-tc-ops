  * Language SC meetings are held the first Monday of each month at 1:00 PM US Eastern time.
  * Actuator Profile SC meetings are held the second and forth Tuesday of each month at 1:00 PM US Eastern time.
  * Implementation Considerations SC meetings are held the first Wednesday of each month at 2:00 PM US Eastern time.

All meetings are nominally scheduled for 1 hour duration, and are conducted using [Lucid Meetings](https://www.lucidmeetings.com/).
