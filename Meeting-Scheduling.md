# Secretary's Notes on Meeting Scheduling

The OASIS Kavi system is the system of record for
OASIS TC operations. The OpenC2 TC uses 
[Lucid Meetings](https://meet.lucidmeetings.com/) 
to conduct TC and SC meetings. The following notes 
capture some useful details regarding the meeting scheduling process. 

* This arrangement requires TC and SC meetings to be
  scheduled in both Kavi & Lucid
  * The TC has been scheduling recurring meeting series in 6-month blocks
  * Scheduling meeting series generates a flurry of calendar invitation emails. Consider sending a "warning order" email to the TC mail list so that members aren't surprised.
  * Consider creating a matrix so you can check off each meeting series as it's scheduled (example at the end of this note) to keep track.
  * SC meetings that occur twice per month require scheduling a series for each session (e.g., 2nd Tuesday, 4th Tuesday are scheduled as two separate series)
  * The monthly TC meeting's mornning and evening sessions likewire require scheduling a series for each session
* The co-chairs have a weekly tag-up (Thursdays at 10:00 AM
  Eastern) that is  only scheduled in Lucid
* The person who schedules a  meeting in Lucid is automatically a facilitator, others need to have their role changed to facilitator.
  * TC co-chairs, all SC co-chairs and Secretary are facilitators for monthly TC meetings.
  * SC co-chairs, TC co-chairs, and secretary are facilitators for all SC meetings.
* Use the _Monthly / Same Day of Week_ repeat schedule for TC and SC meetings (to get, e.g., first Tuesday of month)
* Uncheck the box to receive emails for RSVPs in Lucid if you don't want to get flooded.
* Only Facilitators and Participants can raise hands in Lucid, so set people's roles accordingly. Our convention has been:
  * TC meetings: TC co-chairs and all SC co-chairs are facilitators (enables SC co-chairs to input agenda for SC reports)
  * TC meetings: SC co-chairs for that meeting and TC co-chairs are facilitators
  * Lucid Meetings roles are explained [here](http://support.lucidmeetings.com/support/solutions/articles/16000013446-roles-and-permissions-who-can-do-what-in-lucid)
* Need to use "Edit series attendees" in Lucid to change attendee information for an entire meeting series if you later want to add people or adjust roles
  * Click on the meeting in your Dashboard / Calendar
  * Click on the Attendees tab
  * Select "(Edit series attendees)" in the space above the table of attendees
* We normally invite entire TC membership to both TC and SC meetings, regardless of SC membership elections


**For efficient scheduling in Lucid:**
1. Go into the OpenC2 "room"
1. Pick the agenda template for the TC or SC meeting being scheduled
1. Schedule the meeting (set date, time, repeats, end criteria for repeats; repeats should use the monthly / day of week setting)
1. Add people (sort the room members by role, add all Members / Observers; guests are only invited on a one-off basis)
1. Adjust roles for facilitators
1. Send invite email

We're a big "room" by Lucid standards, some actions take a
little time for processing. Some processing happens in the
background (e.g., invitation email generation and sending),
but not all (e.g., adding people to a meeting series).
Occasionally you may get a "504 Gateway Time-out" error on
the latter; if that happens backtrack to the meeting page
(`meet.lucidmeetings.com/meeting/xxxxxx`) to continue.
Confirm that the people have been added (they usually have).
If you run into issues, the Secretary has an account with
the Lucid Meetings support system, and has been very pleased
with the quality of their support.
