# Secretary's Notes on Meeting Scheduling

The OASIS Kavi system is the system of record for
OASIS TC operations. The OpenC2 TC uses 
[Lucid Meetings](https://meet.lucidmeetings.com/) 
to conduct TC and SC meetings. The following notes 
capture some useful details regarding the meeting scheduling process. 

* This arrangement requires TC and SC meeting to be scheduled in both Kavi & Lucid
  * The TC has been scheduling recurring meeting series in 6-month blocks
  * Scheduling meeting series generates a flurry of calendar invitation emails. Consider sending a "warning order" email to the TC mail list so that members aren't surprised.
  * Consider creating a matrix so you can check off each meeting series as it's scheduled (example at the end of this note) to keep track.
  * SC meetings that occur twice per month require scheduling a series for each session (e.g., 2nd Tuesday, 4th Tuesday are scheduled as two separate series)
* The co-chairs have a weekly tag-up (Thursdays at 3:00 PM Eastern) are only scheduled in Lucid
* The person who schedules a  meeting in Lucid is automatically a facilitator, others need to have their role change to facilitator.
  * TC co-chairs and Secretary are facilitators for TC meetings.
  * SC co-chairs, TC co-chairs, and secretary are facilitators for SC meetings.
* Pick Monthly / Same Day of Week repeat schedule for TC and SC meetings
* Uncheck the box to receive emails for RSVPs in Lucid if you don't want to get flooded.
* Only Facilitators and Participants can raise hands in Lucid, so set people's roles accordingly.
* Need to use "Edit series attendees" in Lucid to change attendee information for an entire meeting series if you later want to add people or adjust roles
  * Click on the meeting in your Dashboard / Calendar
  * Click on the Attendees tab
  * Select "(Edit series attendees)" in the space above the table of attendees
* We normally invite entire TC membership to both TC and SC meetings, regardless of SC membership elections


**For efficient scheduling in Lucid:**
1. Go into the OpenC2 "room"
1. Pick the agenda template for the TC or SC meeting being scheduled
1. Schedule the meeting (set date, time, repeats, end criteria for repeats; repeats should use the monthly / day of week setting)
1. Add people (sort the room members by role, add all Members / Observers; guests are only invited on a one-off basis)
1. Adjust roles for facilitators
1. Send invite email

We're a big "room" by Lucid standards, some actions take a little time for processing. Some processing happens in the background (e.g., invitation email generation and sending), but not all (e.g., adding people to a meeting series). Occasionally you may get a "504 Gateway Time-out" error on the latter; if that happens backtrack to the meeting page (`meet.lucidmeetings.com/meeting/xxxxxx`) to continue. Confirm that the people have been added (they usually have).
