# Secretary's Notes on Meeting Scheduling

The OASIS Kavi system is the system of record for
OASIS TC operations. The OpenC2 TC uses 
[Lucid Meetings](https://meet.lucidmeetings.com/) 
to conduct TC and SC meetings. The following notes 
capture some useful details regarding the meeting scheduling process. 
The Lucid Meetings [Fundamentals: Start Here](http://support.lucidmeetings.com/support/solutions/folders/16000049332)
page provides an introduction to how things are 
organized in Lucid.

* This arrangement requires TC and working meetings to be
  scheduled in both Kavi & Lucid
  * The TC has been scheduling recurring meeting series in 6-month blocks
  * Scheduling meeting series generates a flurry of calendar invitation emails. Consider sending a "warning order" email to the TC mail list so that members aren't surprised.
  * Consider creating a matrix so you can check off each meeting series as it's scheduled (example at the end of this note) to keep track.
  * Working meetings (which occur three times per month) require scheduling a series for each session (e.g., 1st Wednesday, 2nd Wednesday, 4th Wednesday are scheduled as three separate series)
  * The monthly TC meeting's morning and evening sessions likewise require scheduling a series for each session
* The person who schedules a meeting in Lucid is automatically a facilitator, others need to have their role changed to facilitator.
  * TC co-chairs and the secretary are facilitators for monthly TC meetings.
  * TC co-chairs, and the secretary are facilitators for all working meetings. Work product editors will be specified as presenters for their work items in the working meeting agendas
* Use the _Monthly / Same Day of Week_ repeat schedule for meetings (to get, e.g., first Tuesday of month)
* Uncheck the box to receive emails for RSVPs in Lucid if you don't want to get flooded.
* Only Facilitators and Participants can raise hands in Lucid, so set people's roles accordingly. Our convention has been:
  * TC meetings: TC co-chairs and secreatry are facilitators
  * Working meetings: TC co-chairs and secreatry are facilitators; work product editors are made presenters for their portions of the agenda so they can edit them.  
    * NOTE: Lucid only allows one presenter per agenda portion, so if there are multiple editors for a work product one should be identified as the presenter for any particular meeting.
  * Lucid Meetings roles are explained [here](http://support.lucidmeetings.com/support/solutions/articles/16000013446-roles-and-permissions-who-can-do-what-in-lucid)
* Need to use "Edit series attendees" in Lucid to change attendee information for an entire meeting series if you later want to add people or adjust roles
  * Click on the meeting in your Dashboard / Calendar
  * Click on the Attendees tab
  * Select "(Edit series attendees)" in the space above the table of attendees
* The entire TC membership is invited to all TC and working meetings


**For efficient scheduling in Lucid:**
1. Go into the OpenC2 "room"
1. Pick the agenda template for the meeting being scheduled
1. Schedule the meeting (set date, time, repeats, end criteria for repeats; repeats should use the monthly / day of week setting)
1. Add people (sort the room members by role, add all Members / Observers; guests are only invited on a one-off basis)
1. Adjust roles for facilitators
1. Send invite email

We're a big "room" by Lucid standards, some actions take a
little time for processing. Some processing happens in the
background (e.g., invitation email generation and sending),
but not all (e.g., adding people to a meeting series).
Occasionally you may get a "504 Gateway Time-out" error on
the latter; if that happens backtrack to the meeting page
(`meet.lucidmeetings.com/meeting/xxxxxx`) to continue.
Confirm that the people have been added (they usually have).
If you run into issues, the Secretary has an account with
the Lucid Meetings support system, and has been very pleased
with the quality of their support.
