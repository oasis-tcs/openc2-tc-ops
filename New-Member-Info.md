# Secretary's Welcome Message
#### Information for TC members about the OpenC2 TC's operating routine.

Welcome to the OASIS OpenC2 [Technical Committee
(TC)](https://www.oasis-open.org/policies-guidelines/oasis-defined-terms-2018-05-22/#dTechnicalCommittee).
As TC Secretary, I'd like to give you some basics about our TC
operations:

* An overview of the TC, including our [standing
  rules](https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/tc_home.php?wg_abbrev=openc2#other),
  can be found at [our home page at
  OASIS](https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/tc_home.php?wg_abbrev=openc2).   
* General information about OpenC2 can be found at [OpenC2.org](https://openc2.org/)
* General information about OASIS can be found on the organization's [About page](https://www.oasis-open.org/org/)

### Meeting Schedules

* We conduct TC and working meetings using [Lucid
  Meetings](https://www.lucidmeetings.com). As the OASIS Kavi
  system is the system of record for TC activities, you'll
  receive two invitations for any meeting _series_: one from
  Kavi, one from Lucid. We schedule our meetings in 6-month
  blocks, so when we schedule a new block each members receives a brief flurry of 
  email with calendar invitations (10 calendar invites, total).
  * Wednesdays at 11:00 AM Eastern time is "OpenC2 time"
  * Our monthly TC meetings have a daytime (11:00 AM Eastern) and
    evening (9:00 PM Eastern) session on the **third** Wednesday
    of each month. Per [Standing Rule
    #6](https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/tc_home.php?wg_abbrev=openc2#other)
    attendance at either session (which you should record in
    Kavi) constitutes attendance for that month's meeting. We
    treat these two sessions as a single meeting for purposes of
    attendance, [voting
    rights](https://www.oasis-open.org/policies-guidelines/tc-process-2017-05-26/#membership),
    meeting minutes, motions voted, etc. This means decisions
    made at the daytime session are provisional until the evening
    session is adjourned.
  * (_As of April 2021 we have a new standing meeting schedule_).
    The 1st, 2nd, and 4th Wednesdays of each month are used for
    working meeting to discuss topics related to TC work products
    and other technical matters. If there are five Wednesdays in a month, there is no meeting on the 5th Wednesday.
  * In OASIS Kavi, all meetings are scheduled on the TC calendar
  * The entire meeting schedule will be visible on your Lucid
    dashboard and calendar once you've been added to the OpenC2
    "room".
  
  
### TC Communications:
  * In joining our TC you’re automatically subscribed to the TC email list. 
  * We also do much of our communications in our [Slack community](https://openc2-community.slack.com). 
You'll receive an invitation for that as well.

### Work Product Development

* At present most of our work product development is happening on GitHub, 
and there is also a collection of open repositories there with OpenC2 implementations. 
  * [Work product repos](https://github.com/oasis-tcs?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=openc2&type=&language=): specifications and related documents
  * [Open repos](https://github.com/oasis-open?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=openc2-&type=&language=): software contributions
* The TC's [Documentation Norms](Documentation-Norms.md) provides a great deal of
  information regarding our approach to work product development.

* The TC also has a [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/0ByY7rMsnC7rrY1JEMlBLckNXTG8) 
where we did much of our work in the past; 
you can find a lot of history and reference information there.

### Observers

If you joined the TC as an Observer, we welcome your interest and just ask that 
you respect the [limits of that role](https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/roles)
