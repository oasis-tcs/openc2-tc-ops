# General Member Information
#### Information for TC members about the OpenC2 TC's operating routine.

Welcome to the OASIS OpenC2 [Technical Committee
(TC)](https://www.oasis-open.org/policies-guidelines/oasis-defined-terms-2018-05-22/#dTechnicalCommittee).
This brief document provides some basics about our how our TC
operates. First, some useful links:

* An overview of the TC, including our [standing
  rules](https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/tc_home.php?wg_abbrev=openc2#other),
  can be found at [our home page at
  OASIS](https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/tc_home.php?wg_abbrev=openc2).
* General information about OpenC2 can be found at [OpenC2.org](https://openc2.org/)
* General information about OASIS can be found on the organization's [About page](https://www.oasis-open.org/org/)

## Meeting Schedules

The TC conducts our meetings Wednesdays at 11:00 AM Eastern time
("OpenC2 time"). The monthly meeting schedule is as follows:

| **Day** | **Meeting Type** |
|:---:|:---:|
| 1st Wednesday | [Working Meeting](#working-meetings) |
| 2nd Wednesday | [Working Meeting](#working-meetings) |
| 3rd Wednesday | [TC Meeting](#tc-technical-committee-meetings)<br>(2 sessions) |
| 4th Wednesday | [Working Meeting](#working-meetings) |
| 5th Wednesday (if any) | No Meeting |

We conduct all of our meetings using [Lucid
Meetings](https://www.lucidmeetings.com). As the OASIS Kavi
system is the system of record for TC activities, we schedule our
meetings on both the Kavi and Lucid calendars, but members will
only receive one invitation for each meeting series, from Lucid.
Meetings are usually scheduled in 6-month blocks
(March-September, and October-April). When a new block is
scheduled each member receives a brief flurry of email with
calendar invitations (5 calendar invites, total).

## TC (Technical Committee) Meetings

Our monthly TC meetings on the **third** Wednesday of each month
have an "early" (11:00 AM Eastern) session and a "late" (9:00 PM
Eastern) session. The same agenda is used for both sessions, and
the two sessions are treated as a single meeting (see [Standing Rule
#6](https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/tc_home.php?wg_abbrev=openc2#other))
for purposes of attendance, [voting rights](https://www.oasis-open.org/policies-guidelines/tc-process-2017-05-26/#membership),
meeting minutes, motions voted, etc. This also means decisions
made at the daytime session are provisional until the evening
session is adjourned.

## Working Meetings

The 1st, 2nd, and 4th Wednesdays of each month are used for
working meeting to discuss topics related to TC work products and
other technical matters.
